Today, we worked with multiple tables in class. This activity invites you take that work a bit further!

## Project Goals

* To create a multiple-table database from SQL code
* To gain experience with creating an SQL table
* To run some queries that link several tables simultaneously
* To explain how the SQL code completes the queries

## Instructions

Please address the TODO's in the markdown text file, `src/code.md`. You are to submit this work to your GitHub repository at least three (3) times. Your work will be considered complete when you see the green check-mark at the top of page of your GitHub repository.

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:
